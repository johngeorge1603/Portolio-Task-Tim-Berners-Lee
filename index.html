                    <div><p>Timothy John Berners-Lee was born in London on 8 June 1955, the son of mathematicians and computer scientists Mary Lee Woods (1924–2017) and Conway Berners-Lee (1921–2019). His parents were both from Birmingham and worked on the Ferranti Mark 1, the first commercially-built computer. He has three younger siblings; his brother, Mike, is a professor of ecology and climate change management. Berners-Lee attended Sheen Mount Primary School, then attended the Emanuel School from 1969 to 1973. A keen trainspotter as a child, he learnt about electronics from tinkering with a model railway. From 1973 to 1976, he studied at The Queen's College, Oxford, where he received a first-class BA in physics

                        <div><p> The web was originally conceived and developed to meet the demand for automated information-sharing between scientists in universities and institutes around the world.The first website at CERN – and in the world – was dedicated to the World Wide Web project itself and was hosted on Berners-Lee's NeXT computer. In 2013, CERN launched a project to restore this first ever website: info.cern.ch. On 30 April 1993, CERN put the World Wide Web software in the public domain.
